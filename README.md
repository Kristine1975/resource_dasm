# resource_dasm

This project contains multiple tools for reverse-engineering classic Mac OS applications and games.

The tools in this project are:
- General disassemblers
    - **resource_dasm**: reads resources from classic Mac OS resource forks, Mohawk archives, or HIRF/RMF/IREZ/HSB archives, and converts the resources to modern formats and/or exports them verbatim. resource_dasm can also disassemble raw 68k or PowerPC machine code, as well as PEFF executables that contain code for either of those CPU architectures.
    - **libresource_file**: a library implementing most of resource_dasm's functionality
    - **render_bits**: a raw data renderer, useful for figuring out embedded images or 2-D arrays in unknown file formats
- Decompressors/dearchivers for specific formats
    - **dc_dasm**: extracts resources from the DC Data file from Dark Castle and converts the sprites into BMP images
    - **hypercard_dasm**: disassembles HyperCard stacks and draws card images
    - **macski_decomp**: decompresses the COOK/CO2K/RUN4 encodings used by MacSki
- Game sprite renderers
    - **bt_render**: converts sprites from Bubble Trouble and Harry the Handsome Executive into BMP images
    - **sc2k_render**: converts sprites from SimCity 2000 into BMP images
    - **step_on_it_render**: converts sprites from Step On It! into BMP images
    - **thezone_render**: converts sprites from TheZone into BMP images
- Game map generators
    - **ferazel_render**: generates maps from Ferazel's Wand world files
    - **gamma_zee_render**: maps of Gamma Zee mazes
    - **harry_render**: generates maps from Harry the Handsome Executive world files
    - **infotron_render**: generates maps from Infotron levels files
    - **mshines_render**: generates maps from Monkey Shines world files
    - **realmz_dasm**: generates maps from Realmz scenarios and disassembles the scenario scripts into readable assembly-like syntax

## Building

- Install Netpbm (http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/). This is only needed for converting PICT resources that resource_dasm can't decode by itself - if you don't care about PICTs, you can skip this step.
- Install CMake.
- Build and install phosg (https://github.com/fuzziqersoftware/phosg).
- Run `cmake .`, then `make`.

This project should build properly on sufficiently recent versions of macOS and Linux.

## Using resource_dasm

resource_dasm is a disassembler for classic Mac OS resource forks. It extracts resources from the resource fork of any file and converts many classic Mac OS resource formats (images, sounds, text, etc.) into modern formats.

Examples:

    # Disassemble all resources from a specific file (the output is written to
    # the <filename>.out directory by default):
    ./resource_dasm files/Tesserae

    # Disassemble all resources from all files in a folder, writing the output
    # files into a parallel folder structure in the current directory:
    ./resource_dasm "files/Apeiron Æ’/" ./apeiron.out

    # Disassemble a specific resource from a specific file:
    ./resource_dasm "files/MacSki 1.7/MacSki Sounds" ./macski.out \
        --target-type=snd --target-id=1023

    # Disassemble a PowerPC application's resources and its code:
    ./resource_dasm "files/Adventures of Billy" ./billy.out
    ./resource_dasm "files/Adventures of Billy" ./billy.out/dasm.txt \
        --disassemble-pef

    # Due to copying files across different types of filesystems, you might
    # have a file's resource fork in the data fork of a separate file instead.
    # To disassemble such a file:
    ./resource_dasm "windows/Realmz/Data Files/Portraits.rsf" ./portraits.out \
        --data-fork

This isn't all resource_dasm can do; run it without any arguments for further usage information.

### Capabilities

resource_dasm can convert these resource types:

    Notes:
    *0: Produces a 32-bit BMP if a corresponding monochrome resource exists
        (ICN# for icl4/8, icm# for icm4/8, ics# for ics4/8, kcs# for kcs4/8). If
        no monochrome resource exists, produces a 24-bit BMP instead. All color
        information in the original resource is reproduced in the output, even
        for fully-transparent pixels. If the icon was originally intended to be
        used with a nonstandard compositing mode, the colors of fully-
        transparent pixels may have been relevant, but most modern image viewers
        and editors don't have a way to display this information.
    *1: The hotspot coordinates are appended to the output filename. As in *0,
        resource_dasm faithfully reproduces the color values of transparent
        pixels in the output file, but most modern image editors won't show
        these "transparent" pixels.
    *2: resource_dasm implements multiple PICT decoders. It will first attempt
        to decode the PICT using its internal decoder, which usually produces
        correct results but fails on PICTs that contain complex drawing opcodes.
        This decoder can handle basic QuickTime images as well (e.g. embedded
        JPEGs and PNGs), but can't do any drawing under or over them, or
        matte/mask effects. PICTs that contain embedded JPEGs or PNGs will
        result in a JPEG or PNG output rather than a BMP. In case this decoder
        fails, resource_dasm will fall back to a decoder that uses picttoppm,
        which is part of NetPBM. There is a rare failure mode in which picttoppm
        hangs forever; resource_dasm gives it 10 seconds to do its job before
        killing it and giving up. If picttoppm fails to decode the PICT or is
        killed, resource_dasm will prepend the necessary header and save it as a
        PICT file instead of a BMP.
    *3: Text is decoded using the Mac OS Roman encoding and line endings (\r)
        are converted to Unix style (\n).
    *4: Some rare style options may not be translated correctly. styl resources
        provide styling information for the TEXT resource with the same ID, so
        such a resource must be present to properly decode a styl.
    *5: If the data contained in the snd is in MP3 format, exports it as a .mp3
        file. Otherwise, exports it as an uncompressed WAV files, even if the
        resource's data is compressed. resource_dasm can decompress IMA 4:1,
        MACE 3:1, MACE 6:1, A-law, and mu-law (ulaw) compression. A-law
        decompression is not tested; please upload an example file via GitHub
        issue if it doesn't work.
    *6: Instrument decoding is experimental and imperfect; some notes may not
        decode properly. JSON files from SONG resources can be played with
        gctools' smssynth (http://www.github.com/fuzziqersoftware/gctools). When
        playing, the decoded snd/csnd/esnd and MIDI/cmid/emid/ecmi resources
        must be in the same directory as the JSON file and have the same names
        as when they were initially decoded.
    *7: Tune decoding is experimental and will likely produce unplayable MIDIs.
    *8: For color table resources, the raw data is always saved even if it is
        decoded properly, since the original data contains 16-bit values for
        each channel and the output BMP file has less-precise 8-bit channels.
    *9: ESnd resources (as opposed to esnd resources) were only used in two
        games I know of, and the decoder implementation is based on reverse-
        engineering one of those games. The format is likely nonstandard.
    *A: This resource appears to have a fixed format, with a constant sample
        rate, sample width and channel count. You may have to adjust these
        parameters in the output if it turns out that these are configurable.
    *B: The disassembler attempts to find exported functions by parsing the jump
        table in the CODE 0 resource, but if this resource is missing or not in
        the expected format, it skips this step and does not fail. Generally, if
        any "export_X:" labels appear in the disassembly, then export resolution
        succeeded and all of the labels should be correct (otherwise they will
        all be missing). When passing a CODE resource to --decode-type,
        resource_dasm assumes it's not CODE 0 and will disassemble it as actual
        code rather than an import table.
    *C: Floating-point opcodes (F-class) are not implemented and will
        disassemble as ".extension <opcode> // unimplemented".
    *D: Most PowerPC applications have their executable code in the data fork.
        To disassemble it, use the --disassemble-pef option (example above).

If resource_dasm fails to convert a resource, or doesn't know how to, it will attempt to decode the resource using the corresponding TMPL (template) resource if it exists. If there's no appropriate TMPL, the TMPL is corrupt, or the TMPL can't decode the resource, resource_dasm will produce the resource's raw data instead.

Most of the decoder implementations in resource_dasm are based on reverse-engineering existing software and pawing through the dregs of old documentation, so some rarer types of resources probably won't work yet. However, I want this project to be as complete as possible, so if you have a resource that you think should be decodable but resource_dasm can't decode it, send it to me (perhaps by attaching to a GitHub issue) and I'll try my best to make resource_dasm understand it.

#### Compressed resources

resource_dasm transparently decompresses resources that are marked by the resource manager as compressed.

The resource manager compression scheme was never officially documented by Apple or made public, so the implementation of these decompressors is based on guesswork and reverse-engineering ResEdit and other classic Mac OS code. In summary, resources are decompressed by executing 68K or PowerPC code from a dcmp or ncmp resource, which is either contained in the same file as the compressed resource or in the System file. There are two different formats of compressed resources and two corresponding formats of 68K decompressors; resource_dasm implements support for both formats.

resource_dasm contains native implementations of all four decompressors built into the Mac OS System file. Specifically:
- dcmp 0 (DonnDecompress) works
- dcmp 1 (a variant of DonnDecompress) is not tested
- dcmp 2 (GreggyDecompress) is not tested
- dcmp 3 (an LZSS-like scheme) works

resource_dasm has built-in emulators to run non-default decompressors. These emulators can also run the default decompressors, which are included with resource_dasm. Current status of emulated decompressors:
- System dcmp 0 works
- System dcmp 1 is not tested
- System dcmp 2 is not tested
- System dcmp 3 works
- Ben Mickaelian's self-modifying dcmp 128 from After Dark works
- FutureBASIC (probably) dcmp 200 works

There may be other decompressors out there that I haven't seen, which may not work. If you see "warning: failed to decompress resource" when using resource_dasm, please create a GitHub issue and upload the exported compressed resource (.bin file) that caused the failure, and all the dcmp and ncmp resources from the same source file.

### Using resource_dasm as a library

Run `sudo make install` to copy the header files and library to the relevant paths after building.

You can then `#include <resource_file/ResourceFile.hh>` and `#include <resource_file/IndexFormats/ResourceFork.hh>`, then use `parse_resource_fork(resource_fork_data)` to get `ResourceFile` objects in your own projects. Make sure to link with `-lresource_file`. There is not much documentation for this library beyond what's in the header files, but usage of the `ResourceFile` class should be fairly straightforward.

## Using the other tools

### render_bits

render_bits is useful to answer the question "might this random-looking binary data actually be an image or 2-D array?" Give it a color format and some binary data, and it will produce a full-color BMP file that you can look at with your favorite image viewer or editor. If the output looks like garbage, play around with the width and color format until you figure out the right parameters.

Run render_bits without any options for usage information.

### Decompressors/dearchivers for specific formats

- For Dark Castle: `dc_dasm "DC Data" dc_data.out`
- For HyperCard stacks: `hypercard_dasm stack_file [output_dir]`, or just `hypercard_dasm` to see all options
- For MacSki compressed resources: `macski_decomp < infile > outfile`, or use directly with resource_dasm like `resource_dasm --external-preprocessor=./macski_decomp input_filename ...`

### Game sprite renderers

- For Harry the Handsome Executive sprites: `bt_render --hrsp HrSP_file.bin clut_file.bin`
- For Bubble Trouble sprites: `bt_render --btsp btSP_file.bin clut_file.bin`
- For SimCity 2000 sprites: `sc2k_render SPRT_file.bin pltt_file.bin`
- For Step On It sprites: `step_on_it_render sssf_file.bin clut_file.bin`
- For TheZone sprites: `thezone_render Spri_file.bin clut_file.bin`

You can get the sprite and clut/pltt files from the game's data files using resource_dasm. For Harry the Handsome Executive specifically, the game doesn't contain any cluts - you can use a 256-color clut from the Mac OS System file instead.

### Game map generators

- For Ferazel's Wand maps: `ferazel_render` in the directory with the data files, or `ferazel_render --help` to see all the options (there are many!)
- For Gamma Zee maps: `gamma_zee_render gamma_zee_application levels_filename`
- For Harry the Handsome Executive maps: `harry_render --clut-file=clut.bin`, or just `harry_render` to see all the options (there are many!)
- For Infotron maps: `infotron_render` in the Info Datafiles directory
- For Monkey Shines maps: `mshines_render world_file [output_directory]`
- For Realmz maps and scripts: `realmz_dasm global_data_dir [scenario_dir] out_dir` (if scenario_dir is not given, disassembles the shared data instead)

For realmz_dasm, there is a script (realmz_dasm_all.sh) that disassembles all scenarios in a directory. Run it like `realmz_dasm_all.sh "path/to/realmz/folder`; it will produce a directory named realmz_dasm_all.out.
