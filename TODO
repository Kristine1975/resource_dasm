Style:
- Use phosg reverse_endian types and get rid of bswap/byteswap calls

Documented resource formats:
- mctb: http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Toolbox/Toolbox-185.html (there's a TMPL for this too)
- ictb: http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Toolbox/Toolbox-441.html
- ICN#/ics#: can technically have more than a single monochrome image + mask image in them, but we currently don't support this
- moov: these aren't the same as .mov files! see http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/documentation/QuickTime/QTFF/QTFFChap1/chapter_2_section_5.html
- Use ResEdit RMAPs to discover unimplemented equivalent formats
- FOND
- Far model CODE relocation info (http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/runtimehtml/RTArch-129.html)
- ppat type 2 is not monochrome; it's RGB (see QuickDraw docs). Unclear if these are ever stored in resource forks though.

Undocumented resource formats:
- CREL: looks like another form of CODE relocation info; there appear to be at least two different formats (see Realmz 5.1.6 vs. After Dark)
- infa: TMPL from ResEdit appears incorrect
- POST: TMPL from ResEdit appears incorrect

Custom formats used in multiple game/app series:
- 'ajcp' compression/encryption (used in Zen and Prince of Darkness... is it a FutureBASIC thing?)
- Lemmings / Prince of Persia: SHPD (these look like references to segments of the data fork), SHPT
- hypercard_dasm fails horrendously on Spelunx and its secondary stacks (probably the stack format is intermediate)

Custom formats used by a single game/app series:
- Realmz (realmz_dasm)
- - Rogue encounter and item IDs (and result codes) appear incorrect in complex encounter disassembly
- - Custom choice option strings seem wrong in script disassembly
- - Localize things better in script disassembly (e.g. paste XAP disassembly into places where XAPs are referenced; paste complex encounter disassembly into complex_encounter opcodes, etc.)
- Avara: HSND (has TMPL, but appears to also have undocumented compression)
- Dark Castle / Beyond Dark Castle: PPCT, SOUN, and maybe PSCR
- DeadEnd: SNGV (seems to be a very simple sequence format; it has a TMPL even)
- Factory: 1img, 4img, 8img (these look like just fixed-size uncompressed images; find the right clut and render them)
- Mario Teaches Typing: Img, Pak (sprites, probably)
- Spectre Supreme: shap (these might be 3D shapes)
- Swamp Gas: PPic
