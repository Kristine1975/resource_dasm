Documented resource formats:
- mctb: http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Toolbox/Toolbox-185.html (there's a TMPL for this too)
- ictb: http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Toolbox/Toolbox-441.html
- ICN#/ics#: can technically have more than a single monochrome image + mask image in them, but we currently don't support this
- moov: these aren't the same as .mov files! see http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/documentation/QuickTime/QTFF/QTFFChap1/chapter_2_section_5.html
- Use ResEdit RMAPs to discover unimplemented equivalent formats
- FOND

Undocumented resource formats:
- CREL: looks like CODE relocation info. there appear to be at least two different formats (see Realmz 5.1.6 vs. After Dark)
- infa: TMPL from ResEdit appears incorrect
- POST: TMPL from ResEdit appears incorrect

Specific games/apps:
- 'ajcp' compression/encryption (used in Zen and Prince of Darkness... is it a FutureBASIC thing?)
- DeadEnd SNGV (seems to be a very simple sequence format; it has a TMPL even)
- Avara HSND (has TMPL)
- realmz_dasm
- - Rogue encounter and item IDs (and result codes) appear incorrect in complex encounter disassembly
- - Custom choice option strings seem wrong in script disassembly
- - Localize things better in script disassembly (e.g. paste XAP disassembly into places where XAPs are referenced; paste complex encounter disassembly into complex_encounter opcodes, etc.)
