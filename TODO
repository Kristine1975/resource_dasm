Decompressors:
Implement system dcmps as native code; get rid of the system_dcmps folder

Resource formats:
mctb (http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Toolbox/Toolbox-185.html) (there's a TMPL for this too)
ictb (http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Toolbox/Toolbox-441.html)
ICN# and ics# can technically have more than a single monochrome image + mask image in them, but we currently don't support this
CREL - looks like CODE relocation info. there appear to be at least two different formats (see Realmz 5.1.6 vs. After Dark)
moov - these aren't the same as .mov files! see http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/documentation/QuickTime/QTFF/QTFFChap1/chapter_2_section_5.html
INST/SONG extra data from TMPLs (TODOs in ResourceFile.cc)
Use ResEdit RMAPs to discover unimplemented equivalent formats

Resource formats with TMPLs that we can implement:
FOND
infa (TMPL from ResEdit appears incorrect)
POST (TMPL from ResEdit appears incorrect)

Games/apps:
Greebles GSIF resources (all graphics)
Greebles MDAT resources (sequenced music - probably refers to QuickTime Instruments since the game doesn't include snds that would be appropriate)
TheZone Spri resources (these include executable code... ugh)
Prince of Darkness 'ajcp' compression/encryption
DeadEnd SNGV (seems to be a very simple sequence format; it has a TMPL even)
Avara HSND (has TMPL)
